# SyntheticAerialRobotics
Working repository for control software and Arduino code to choreograph a robotic performance. Using 4 stepper motors, drivers and software.

### Arduino

#### AccelStepper_test
A working sketch that allows serial communication to control and calibrate a single motor driver.

#### AccelStepper_x2
A working sketch that allows serial communication to control and calibrate two stepper motors simultaniously.

### Processing

#### single_stepper_controller
A working sketch that includes all basic interface elements necessary to interact with a single motor.

### Datasheets

The specifications for the components used for this particular installation. Stepper motors and A4988 Polulo stepper driver.

### Design Files

quadstepper.fzz - The circuit diagram and components created in Fritzing.
powersupply.pdf - The power supply used for the installation 12V 5A
motor-unit.ai - The illustrator file used to fabricate the acrylic sheets to assemble the four motor units. This file is to scale but some measurements are imprecise.
